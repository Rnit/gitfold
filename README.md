# FRAMINGHAM HEART STUDY USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION #

In the late 1940s, the US government set out to better understand cardiovascular disease.
The plan was to track a large cohort of initially healthy patients over their lifetimes.
A city was chosen, the city of **Framingham**, Massachusetts, to be the site for the study.
Framingham has an appropriate size.
It's not too large, it's not too small.
It has a stable population that doesn't move too much. And the doctors and residents were quite cooperative.
So in 1948, the Framingham Heart Study started. The study included 5,209 patients, aged 30 to 59.
Patients were given a questionnaire and an examination every two years.
During this examination, their physical characteristics were recorded, their behavioral characteristics, as well as
test results.

Exams and questions expanded over time, but the key in the study was that the trajectory
of the health of the patients was followed during their entire lifespan.
In this code I built models using the Framingham data *this data comes from* [BioLINCC WEBSITE](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/static/studies/teaching/framdoc.pdf) to predict and prevent heart disease.
